# FullPack (OLDER) for CS 1.6
This older FullPack contains latest AMX Mod X, DProto and VTC.

This FullPack is useful for servers that have plugins that aren't mostly compatible with the latest ReGameDLL and ReHLDS.

This Full Pack also includes the corrected geoip_amxx_i386.so and GeoLite2-City.mmdb files.

## Installation
- We will need a clean installation of the game server Counter-Strike 1.6.

- After installing the server, we will download the latest Release.

- We will copy and replace all files into the main server folder (/).

- Then we need to chmod the files to 0777 (otherwise an error would be displayed in the server console, indicating that the files do not have permission).

- Done.
